ODIN PROJECT 1 "Recipe Website with HTML"
   
     This is my first project within The Odin Project and it will consist of making a simple website linking to recipes using exclusively HTML.
     
      I will be using HTML knowledge acquired so far on the odin project, including such skills as   creating a webpage, attributing it a title, giving it a header, paragraphs, ordered list, unordered list, an outside link to an external website...ect.
